If you are using smithed and want emissive textures on the items and mobs that should have them, install [this resourcepack](https://github.com/primalugly/Ocean-Additions/releases/download/untagged-0c3212d7f13518a76031/Ocean_Additions_Resourcepack_Emissives.zip), however it may not work on your system.
